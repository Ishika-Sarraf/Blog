    An Internship Provides Real<br> Life Experience and<br> Exposure. Employers in<br> today's labor market rely<br> heavily on resumes that<br> illustrate a relevant work<br> history, whether that's<br> from internships, volunteer<br> work, or actual job<br> experience. A practical<br> work background carries<br> a major significance when<br> attempting to enter<br> the job market. It's <br>all about competition.<br><br>

    The experiences we go<br> through are what shapes us.<br> Your internship will not only<br> encourage personal<br> development, but also a greater<br> understanding of self.<br> To know yourself is<br> to know your goals and how<br> to best achieve them. Finding<br> this level of clarity is difficult,<br> but sometimes all it takes <br>is trying someone new, out <br>of your comfort zone.<br><br>

Networking is an exchange<br> of information between<br> people, with the ultimate goal<br> of establishing<br> acquaintances and<br> relationships to advance your<br> professional career. Sure,<br> you can attend a networking <br>event without doing an <br>internship, but you would be<br> limiting yourself. Partaking <br>in an internship allows you to <br>establish deeper relationships <br>than you normally would talking<br> to a stranger one-on-one.<br><br>

The student is given a<br> chance to decide whether<br> they wish to continue with<br> their current career path or<br> try something else. The more<br> experience you acquire, the <br>better you position yourself <br>for success in landing a job.<br> An internship is the building<br> blocks necessary for creating<br> the path to a successful career.<br> So next time you're on a gap <br>year or summer break,<br> you might want to consider<br> indulging in a meaningful internship<br> and build towards your future.<br>
